![Reborn](http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19894695/myblog/reborn.jpg)

I am using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) now. I was using WordPress before but decided to switch.


## Why am I using "Reborn" term?

Because this is a reborn for my blogging. I've removed al the clutter and now hope for adding more values here regularly. 

## Why I switched to Jekyll

There is nothing wrong with WordPress. I still use WordPress for some other sites and recommend it. 

* I took a monthly challenge to learn Rails and needed a live project. Jekyll is built using Rails and I thought it'll be good idea to use it.

* I really liked how fast Jekyll was. All the posts and pages are static html. So, there are no more server side scripting or plugin to deal with.

* Jekyll seems to be more secure. I don't have to worry about the Database or the plugin vulnerabilities anymore.

* I can focus more on writing now. I used to spend a lot of time in changing themes, adding new features but With Jekyll minimalism comes.

## What about costs with Jekyll?

I'm using GitHub Pages. It's free and blazing fast. I am using my Dropbox to host the images.

So, everything is for free now.
