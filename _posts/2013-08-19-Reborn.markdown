If you are a regular visitor to this blog (I doubt it though), you might be able to spot some big changes. If you are a newsletter or feed subscriber, I request you to visit the blog.

![Reborn](http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19894695/myblog/reborn.jpg)

I am using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) now. Before Jekyll, the blog was made using WordPress.


## Why am I using "Reborn" term?

Because this really is a reborn for my blogging. I've removed old useless articles. I have switched to a new blogging platform. 

Also, I have decided to share my experiences and learning in more personal way. You will find not only marketing/ecommerce articles here but life lessons or other valueble insights.

## Why I switched to Jekyll

There is nothing wrong with WordPress. I still use WordPress for some other sites and love it. Then why the switch?

* I took a monthly challenge to learn Rails and needed a live project. Jekyll is built using Rails and I thought it'll be good idea to use it.

* I really liked how fast Jekyll was. All the posts and pages are in static html. So, there are no more server loads or plugin to deal with.

* Jekyll seems to be more secure. I was hacked before and now I don't have to worry about the Database or the plugin vulnerabilities.

* I can focus more on writing now. I used to spend a lot of time in changing themes, adding new features but with Jekyll minimalism comes for free.


## What about the costs with Jekyll?

I'm using GitHub Pages. It's free and incredibly fast. I am using my Dropbox public folder to host the images.

So, I don't have to pay for the hosting.

## Next step

I'll be adding some new articles in near future. Wish me luck for the Reborn!
