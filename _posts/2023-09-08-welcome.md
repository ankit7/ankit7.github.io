Welcome! Another attempt to blog regularly this time.

Replced WordPress with Jekyll. Nothing was wrong with WordPress but the hacker in me wanted to use a static generator. I have some experience with Jekyll and find it delightful. So, switched to Jekyll. Another advtange of free and no-frills hosting at github pages for jekyll.

I am not going to promise to be a regular blogger. Promises rarely hold. However, I'm going to try harder this time and not wait for the perfect content. This will be a raw and unsophisticated place.

A place for my thoughts to get out of my mind and out to to the world.
