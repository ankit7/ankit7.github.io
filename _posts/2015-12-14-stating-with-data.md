title: Just start with data
---
I asked Grok about my biggest blind spots, inspired by Mark Manson't prompts, and it returned the following answers.

1. You undervalue your own time massively
2. You’re allergic to asking for help early
3. Perfectionism disguised as pragmatism (Good enough + shipped + making money almost always beats pixel-perfect but delayed three months.)
4. You don’t celebrate or even acknowledge wins.
5. You’re wasting the compounding leverage of audience & authority
6. I am not building a personal moat.

I have to say the 3rd point kind of hit me hard. I do tend to fuss over the best way or a tool to start a project. The search itself tend to be the most exciting thing than shipping a product. I am like a kid always looking for shiny new toy to play with.

As most of my projects are related to building something using programming - I've decided to just focus on the data from day one. Anything else would be just an end to get and serve important data as fast as possible.

I've nothing against learning something new. Hell, I can't even stop myself from the lure of new and shiny tech but that won't be under the disguise of being productive towards the goal.

Let's see how it changes the time to come.
