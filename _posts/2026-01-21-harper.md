title: Harper - VS Code based Grammar/Spell checker
permalink: /harper/

VS Code is my primary code editor. Previously, I used to write the blog post in VS Code and then spell-check using Proton Doc. Found that process very cumbersome. Opening browser and copy/paste wasn't very fun.

I started writing on Apple notes. It kind of worked well. But nothing beats having a spell-checker right in your editor.

After failed attempts to find the extension using VS Code marketplace, I accidentally stumbled onto [Harper](https://writewithharper.com/). It is fast, and comes with an LSP which makes everything much easier.

Removed one more friction! Here's to writing more in future!
