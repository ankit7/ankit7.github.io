You have read all about [Exact Match Domain (EMD) algorithm effect](https://www.google.com/search?q=exact+match+domain+effect&pws=0) and how it is supposed to remove the low quality websites tricking to get the higher ranks. Here is what Matt Cutts tweeted:

Well, I have a case to share. I was going through my SpyFu account and searching for keywords with highest CPC. A [link](http://www.spyfu.com/TopList.aspx?listId=3) to those keywords.

**mesothelioma firm** is listed on 57th place with CPC of $207.83. I validated this CPC data using Google Adwords tool and it was confirmed. $214.64 for a click. Can you believe that?

Now, I did a quick search for **[mesothelioma firm](http://www.google.com/search?q=mesothelioma+firm&pws=0) **and the site http://www.mesotheliomafirm.com/ was on top. I opened the website and WTF! This is just a WordPress website with almost no content.

I was strong believer that EMD update with demote this site. So, there might be some other cases.

1. A real site in past before the current site to earn the position

2. Backlink spamming to trick the ranking

3. Exact match domain effect still exist


I checked Archive.org Wayback machine and looked for any 'real website' in past. Found some stored copies but they had the same content as current site. Link to [Archive.org result](http://web.archive.org/web/20110130093806/http://www.mesotheliomafirm.com/) also the post date on current website is 27 Oct 2010, so it doesn't make any sense.

I also did a backlink analysis on [Open Site Explorer](http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/links?site=mesotheliomafirm.com) and there was nothing in there. No backlinks, Domain authority only 1 and even after that site ranks at top. I never seen any website with only 1 Domain authority to get the top place.

So, the only theory which makes sense that 'Exact match Domain' was working for this domain. I have not much results to contradict the EMD algo update but this is some hope for spammers. Got anything to share?
