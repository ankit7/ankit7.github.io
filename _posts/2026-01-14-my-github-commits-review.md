I've been seriously coding since late 2020. The desire to ship more will be tracked by how many required (Not trying to game the numbers) commits I've pushed to Github.

This is where I stand now:
* 326 contributions in 2020
* 661 contributions in 2021
* 619 contributions in 2022
* 777 contributions in 2023
* 556 contributions in 2024
* 526 contributions in 2025
* 28 contributions in 2026

2023 stands at highest with around 2/day. The goal for this year is 1000+ commits. Here's to ship more!
