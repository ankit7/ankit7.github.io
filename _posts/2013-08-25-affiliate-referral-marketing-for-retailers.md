title: Affiliate/Referral Marketing campaign for Indian Retailers
---
No one has written about affiliate/referral campaigns targeting Indian retailers. So, I am adding my two cents here.

Note- I'll be using a/r as a short-cut for Affiliate/Referral in this article. 

## Do you need an Affiliate or Referral marketing campaign?

You might be wondering if your business needs such campaigns. Youâ€™re already spending a good amount of money into different channels. You're doing SEO, PPC, Re-marketing and Social marketing etc. Why invest time and resources in another marketing channel? 

The answer is Yes. You do need a/r marketing campaign. If managed correctly, these campaigns might become an important asset.

**Some facts:**

* Total Number of Affiliates have increased by 42% in 2012.
* 'Online Affiliate' was voted #1 job of 2012 by a recent article from MSNBC.
* A referred customer has a 16% higher life-time value (LTV) according to The Wharton School Business.
* 83% of satisfied customers are willing to refer.

**Advantages:**

* Pay for performance model helps for controlling costs.
* More exposure and buzz helps brand to gain more recognition

## Difference between an affiliate and referral marketing campaign
An affiliate has financial motivation. He doesn't know about the referred customers personally and uses a broadcasting medium to promote.

Referral marketing is based on the relationship between referrer and potential customers rather than financial motivation. A referrer recommends to his friends or family members using direct communication.

## Businesses using a/r campaigns in India
I'm not really sure about the exact number but these popular stores are benefiting from such campaigns.

1. Flipkart 
2. Jabong
3. Myntra
4. MakeMyTrip
5. Yatra
6. FreeCultr
7. Via

And the list goes on.

* Fix your Conversion Rate if you're willing to use Affiliate campaign. Affiliates hate low converting websites. 
* Test incentives and promotional materials to find out which drives more conversion
* Connect with affiliates/referrers at regular basis. Teaching them a bit about marketing will benefit both parties.
