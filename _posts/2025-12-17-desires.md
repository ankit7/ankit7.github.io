I read this article - [Thin Desires Are Eating Your Life](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/thin-desires-are-eating-your-life/).

The striking lines were - *__A thick desire is one that changes you in the process of pursuing it. A thin desire is one that doesn't.__*

Buddhism has something similar about desires being root cause of all problems. Which thin desires drive me? Which thick desires I should be having?

I don't care for any digital attention. I don't use the communication app for anything other than catching up. However, some of my actions are related to ego boosting. I do tend to indulge in silly activities a tad more than one should be.

I am always in awe of people who constantly ship. I want to be well read. I need to learn how to keep instant gratification in check. I gotta exercise more. Get some hobbies which involve entire family.

The problem is not knowing what to improve. We tend to prioritize instant gratification over longer, more meaningful act. The practice of reminding oneself what's important all the time should become a habit.
