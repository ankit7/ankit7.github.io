I've been a subscriber of [John Calhoun](https://www.calhoun.io/) newsletters and bought few courses from him. He sent this email a bit ago which contained the following.

"In my case, it meant that the number of sales I make on my paid Go courses has been steadily declining. Not enough that I plan to stop updating existing courses and working on new ones, but enough that I cannot dedicate as much time to free resources as I have in the past."

There was a submission on hackernew fews days ago - [Your SaaS is my weekend project](https://sderosiaux.medium.com/your-saas-is-now-my-weekend-project-what-is-your-moat-e2a2256a390e). It's going to be much more challenging for micro-SaaS. You can't just build something simple and milk that for a prolonged period.

I recently deleted all the programming books from my iCloud except a few. Lot of them were old and I haven't even opened most of them in a while. I had a sense of pride for my digital book collection but I just don't see the point of storing old education books.

All the news and developments in Ai hint that it's going to get harder for people trying to make living as a programmer. A single programmer will be able to do the work of many and you'll have many 10x programmers with advancement of coding models.

What should I do? How do I secure the future? If I'd enough money to retire, I wouldn't have to worry. The future seems bleak.

Prepare for the worst and hope for the best! I should just start saving money like a madman and reach a figure where I can retire easily.

Let's see what the future holds!
