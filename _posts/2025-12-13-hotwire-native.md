title: 'Hotwire native is awesome'
---
One of the web apps I built uses node along with Turbo and Stimulus. No fancy frontend framework like React/Vue/Svelte, and responses are 90% server-rendered HTML. I've managed to get an Android app published by using Hotwire Native. The iOS app keeps getting rejected, but I am somewhat sure that it's not the framework's fault.

The entire experience has been very fun. I got to learn more about Kotlin and Swift. Both of the languages are very different than JS and node. However, I am glad I chose this path over other options available.

Why not just use something like Expo? Well, I've tried, but then I would have to build all screens from scratch. With Hotwire Native, your web app becomes a mobile app out of the box. You sprinkle it along with native elements/pages as needed.

Why not something like Ionic? A Lot less complicated than Expo but it works untill a point. When you have to build custom pages like subscriptions, you start getting into trouble.

I am glad that I chose this framework. However for a new mobile only app,  I would go for a native app using SwiftUI/Jetpack compose. If the web app exists, Hotwire native will be recommended 100% of the time.
