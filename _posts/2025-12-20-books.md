I managed to finish two books this week: *The Rainmaker* and *The Widow*,, both by John Grisham. I am a fan of John Grisham's legal novels. Here are the ultra-short reviews.

## The Rainmaker
I loved it. A David vs. Goliath kind of story where you're always cheering for the hero. Almost 600 pages long but quite a page-turner. Recommended!
## The Widow
Can't bring myself to recommend this book. It's around 400 pages. I didn't feel much joy after it was over. Not really as powerful as other works by John Grisham.
