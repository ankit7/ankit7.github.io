I really want to publish more often. What are the blockers?

1. Is it relavant - Does the world really need to hear my voice? Do I really have anything useful to add?
2. I suck at writing.
3. Laziness - It's really hard to not get distracted these days with so much going on.
4. Lack of Audience - I am pretty sure no one reads my blog. Not even my wife.

However, I've challenged to post regularly (Possibly daily) from now on.
A no-point, no-audience and terribly bad blog is the goal. A way to document the life I'm going through.

May the writing continues!

Amen!
