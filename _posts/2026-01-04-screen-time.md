I am not happy with my smartphone over-usages as probably billion others.
2026 is the [year of less](/less/) for me. I do have time limits on time wasters apps/sites but I am not feeling guilty enough to bypass them.

The metric I think will help minimizing this madness would be daily pickup. It's currently more than 100+ times a day.
Just focusing on one thing - picking up phone making a conscious decision should do the job. That's what I'm going to do.
There should be an app where you can share your phone screen time and feel embarrassed publicly.
