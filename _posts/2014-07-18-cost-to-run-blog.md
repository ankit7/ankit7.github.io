title: How much does it cost to run this blog?
---

$15/year- Yes, you read it right. I just have to pay for the domain renewal each year. It could have been even lower if I switched to a different domain registrar. 

I use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. It is free and reliable with great uptime. 

My CMS (Content Management System) [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), integrated beautifully with GitHub Pages. Thanks to the static files, The blog is amazingly faster than it used to be on WordPress. If you know how to use GitHub and MarkDown syntax. you will love Jekyll. If you are not very technical, just get a domain and use [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) or [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com). Both of them are ad free (unlike WordPress.com) and reliable. 

I use [MadMimi](http://bit.ly/ak-madmimi) for email marketing. I don't have a big list (You should subscribe though), so its free plan is enough. 

Some other tools being used are [Inspectlet](http://bit.ly/ak-inspectlet), [Google Tag Manager](http://www.google.com/tagmanager) and [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics).  All of them are free (except Inspectlet) and recommended.
