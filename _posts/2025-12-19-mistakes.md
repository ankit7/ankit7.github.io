The above quotes can pretty much sum up my past mistakes. I am never content. Never has been. Always restless.

When you assume you're smarter than others, mistakes happen. You do things again and again just to prove something to world. You become an addict for whom the next bet is the one where he will make it big. And as expected, that rarely happens.

Life is good. It's better than what I imagined 20 years ago. I do well financially and haven't put myself in some stupid pickle.

I just have to focus my energy on playing long term games. Short time games don't seem to work well and I don't think I am getting any wisdom out of them.
