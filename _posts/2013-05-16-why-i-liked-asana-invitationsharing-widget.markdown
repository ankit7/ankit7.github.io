title: Why I liked Asana invitation/sharing widget?

---

I use [Asana](http://asana.com/) for project management. It's free (upto 25 users) and its minimal interface/concept makes you more productive.

Well, Asana has this really cool invitation/sharing widget for first time users. I really hate sending annoying invitations for new services I found but this one was something different. See image below and let me know if I'm right.

## Why I liked it?


I have tried to explain my points on the image below. I am not really good with graphics but it should work. In short, It was a good work on smart copy and minimal design.

1. **Focus on different personas** (Asana is for photographer, Sales director and for everyone)
	
2. **Rational justification** with headline - Everyone needs Asana.

3. **Motivation** to help others -  Invite your friends so they can get organized now.

4. **Recommendation** message - 'I'm using Asana and though you might like it as well'.

5. **Assurance**- Just to make sure that your data won't be shared.

6. **Clear call to action**- 'Share Asana' and not typical 'Invite friends'.

So if you have an app or service which promotes user invitation, time to think again.
