Hello Friend,

My name is Ankit. First of all, I thank you for showing interest. I feel very honored when someone wants to know about me after looking over my work.


Quick link- [Contact](http://ankitkumar.in/contact/)


### **A bit about me**


I am Freelance **E-commerce, Internet Marketing Consultant and Conversion Optimizer** by profession. My Job is to make sure my clients are utilizing the power of Internet effectively. I am working on my consulting and services page and you'll see it in near future.

I am a Computer Engineering Bachelor and I wish to Doctorate in Economics (Strange, isn't it?). Currently, I live in a very small town called Manenedragarh in Chhattisgarh state, India.

I love Movies and once even thought about being a Film Critic. I have watched more movies than an average person watches in his lifetime and I am not even 25 yet.

I love nature and my bucket list has a long list of exotic destinations.


I created a Mantra for my life- **Live, Create, Learn and Survive. **The primary purpose is to work more for Live, create part and less involvement for survive part.


I am really into Information and facts/trivia. The idea of being an information-tank really excites me. That's why I am addicted to [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Ankit-Kumar), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/akravi) and Google Reader.


### **Internet as a Career**


It was Feb 2007 and I got the '**Digit's Fast Track guide to Blogging**'. The idea of making money by writing and sharing knowledge was really attractive.

I thought about choosing Internet as my career medium seriously when I was enrolled in Engineering. I never liked the idea of **Rat Race**([?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_race)). Internet seemed the only option to differentiate myself. So, I started a blog in Hindi named as 'Pratham'.

I wrote about Blogging and social media in Pratham. The blog became popular and learned about Internet Marketing while writing and promoting my posts.

I really wanted to make money but a popular Hindi blog was not that helpful. After several attempt of monetization (Adsense, Adbrite etc), I started searching for "make money online' stuff and stumbled into SliceThePie.

SliceThePie (No longer accessible from India) was offering money for reviewing audio tracks. I made sufficient enough from the service to pay my bills. But the process was so boring (Listen to new audio tracks and then writing review) that I started searching for another medium to make some money.


### **Enter Freelancing**


I was in every CrowdSourcing site like [oDesk](http://www.odesk.com), [Elance](http://bit.ly/ak-elance) etc. I got my first project from ScriptLance in Nov 2008. It was a **Blog Commenting **task and paid $15 for 3 hours job. $5/hr was really good to love the idea of freelancing.

I did a good job and client re-hired me for $200 worth of project. I was also able to land some more projects from oDesk after getting the confident from my first service review.

I did everything back there. I was writing articles, working as Affiliate Manager, Installing WordPress, Google Analytics reports and SEO. I was learning every single day and studying more than 500 articles/day.

I also started a small firm but it didn't go well. We were immature but I learned some really great life lessons.

Then idea of Specialization came into mind and I got into Web Analytics. Then, it leads to offering consultation for improving traffic and conversion and finally E-commerce Conversion.

Now, I am a full-time Freelancer and I am lovin it! I have worked with very interesting guys and some of the clients are with me even after a year.

If you're thinking about Freelancing, Don't run after money! **Money will eventually come if you try to build good relationship with good people.**


### Goals


To create a lifestyle which let me focus more on ‘Creation and Living’ part. I am inspired by [4 Hours Work Week](http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Anywhere/dp/0307353133) and Digital Nomad([?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad)) concepts. I want to travel world and work from anywhere.

I am working on some niche sites and will post about them after some time. Nothing else….

Wish me luck!

Thanks for reading about me. I really appreciate it.

Thanks again

Ankit
